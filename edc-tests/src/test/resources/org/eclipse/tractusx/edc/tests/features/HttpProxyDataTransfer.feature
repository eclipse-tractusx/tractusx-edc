Feature: HttpProxy Data Transfer

  Background: The Connector State
    Given 'Plato' has an empty database
    Given 'Sokrates' has an empty database

  Scenario: Connector transfers data via HttpProxy
    Given 'Plato' has a http proxy assets
      | id      | description               | baseUrl                                  |
      | asset-1 | http proxy transfer asset | http://localhost:8081/api/check/liveness |
    And 'Plato' has the following policies
      | id       | action |
      | policy-1 | USE    |
    And 'Plato' has the following contract definitions
      | id                    | access policy | contract policy | asset   |
      | contract-definition-1 | policy-1      | policy-1        | asset-1 |
    When 'Sokrates' negotiates the contract successfully with 'Plato'
      | contract offer id     | asset id | policy id |
      | contract-definition-1 | asset-1  | policy-1  |
    And 'Sokrates' initiates HttpProxy transfer from 'Plato'
      | asset id | receiverHttpEndpoint |
      | asset-1  | http://backend:8080  |
    Then the backend application of 'Sokrates' has received data

  Scenario: Connector transfers data via HttpProxy, data on provider side requires oauth2 authentication
    Given 'Plato' has a http proxy assets
      | id      | description               | baseUrl                                  | oauth2 token url     | oauth2 client id  | oauth2 client secret | oauth2 scope |
      | asset-1 | http proxy transfer asset | http://localhost:8081/api/check/liveness | http://ids-daps:4567 | data-plane-oauth2 | supersecret          | openid       |
    And 'Plato' has the following policies
      | id       | action |
      | policy-1 | USE    |
    And 'Plato' has the following contract definitions
      | id                    | access policy | contract policy | asset   |
      | contract-definition-1 | policy-1      | policy-1        | asset-1 |
    When 'Sokrates' negotiates the contract successfully with 'Plato'
      | contract offer id     | asset id | policy id |
      | contract-definition-1 | asset-1  | policy-1  |
    And 'Sokrates' initiates HttpProxy transfer from 'Plato'
      | asset id |
      | asset-1  |
    Then the backend application of 'Sokrates' has received data
