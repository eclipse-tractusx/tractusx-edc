# Control Plane

The Eclipse Dataspace Connector consists of a **Control Plan** and a **Data Plane** Application.
While the **Data Plane** handles the actual Data Transfer, the **Control Plane** is responsible for:

- Resource Management (e.g. Assets, Policies & Contract Definitions CRUD)
- Contract Offering & Contract Negotiation
- Data Transfer Coordination / Management

The only API that is protected by some kind of security mechanism is the Data Management API. At the time of writing this is done by a simple API key.
The key value must be configured in `edc.api.auth.key`. All requests to the Data Management API must have `X-Api-Key` header with the key value.

Example:
```bash
curl -X GET <URL> --header "X-Api-Key: <edc.api.auth.key>"
```

# Known Control Plane Issues

Please have a look at the open issues in the open source repository. The list below might not be maintained well and
only contains the most important issues.

**Please note** that some of these issues might already be fixed on the EDC main branch, but are not part of the specific
EDC commit the Product-EDC uses.

**Configuration**
- Contract negotiation not working when `web.http.ids.path` is configured/changed ([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1249))
  - **Workaround:** Don't configure `web.http.ids.path`, so that the default path is used.

**Data Management API**
- Contract negotiation not working when initiated with policy id ([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1251))
  - **Workaround:** The DataManagement API can also initiate a contract negotiation using the actual policy object.

- Contract-Offer-Receiving-Connectors must also pass the ContractPolicy of the ContractDefinition before receiving offers([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1331))

- Deletion of Asset becomes impossible when Contract Negotiation exists([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1403))
  - **Workaround:** Delete Asset from DB manually. Be aware that deleting Assets, that are part of a ContractNegotiation or ContractAgreement, may corrupt the connector instance!

- Deletion of Policy becomes impossible when Contract Definition exists([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1410))
  - **Workaround:** Delete Policy from DB manually. Be aware that deleting Policies, that are part of a ContractDefinition, ContractNegotiation or ContractAgreement, may corrupt the connector instance!

**Other**
- Non-IDS-Transformable-ContractDefinition causes connector to be unable to send out self-descriptions/catalogs([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1265))
  - **Workaround:** Delete non-transformable ContractDefinition or Policy.

**Security**
- DataAddress is passed unencrypted from DataProvider to DataConsumer ([issue](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspaceconnector/DataSpaceConnector/issues/1504))
  - **Workaround:** Use only test data!
