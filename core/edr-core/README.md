# EDR Core Extension

This extension provide a base implementation of `EdrManager` and `EdrService` both
required for interacting with the EDR APIs and state machine

The EDR state machine handle the lifecycle of a negotiated EDR. The negotiation request can be submitted
via EDR APIs, and it will go through two phases:

- Contract Negotiation
- Transfer Request

## EDR Core Configuration

The new API is seamlessly deployed under the well-known management API context, requiring no additional configuration.
However, this is not the case for the EDR Cache storage. The EDR Cache provides two implementations: `InMemory` and `SQL`.
The `edc-runtime-memory` bundle utilizes the `InMemory` implementation for the EDR Cache without any extra setup.
On the other hand, the SQL Cache, found in the `edc-controlplane-postgresql-*` bundles, utilizes the SQL implementation
and requires database access for schema migration and data management.

## EDR state machine Configuration

Once the Transfer Request has completed, the EDR entry will be saved with the associated EDR in the primordial state `NEGOTIATED`
The state machine will also manage the lifecycle and the renewal of the `EDR`. If a token is about to expire it will
transition to the `REFRESHING` state and fire off another transfer process with the same parameter of the expiring
one. Once completed the new `EDR` will be cached and the old ones, with same `assetId` and `agreementId` will transition
into the `EXPIRED` state. Then the state machine will also monitor the `EXPIRED` ones, and will delete them according to the
retention configuration.
