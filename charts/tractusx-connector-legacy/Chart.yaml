deprecated: true
description: |
  A Helm chart for Tractus-X Eclipse Data Space Connector. The connector deployment consists of two runtime consists of a
  Control Plane and a Data Plane. Note that _no_ external dependencies such as a PostgreSQL database and HashiCorp Vault are included.

  This chart is intended for use with an _existing_ PostgreSQL database and an _existing_ HashiCorp Vault.

  Deprecation notice: this chart uses DAPS, which was replaced with an SSI solution in v0.5.0 of Tractus-X EDC and is thus deprecated.
  It will not be maintained, supported or tested anymore and it will be removed in future versions.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application
# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.5.0
# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
