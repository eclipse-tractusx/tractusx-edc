## WHAT

## WHY
// outlines the motivation, why the feature is desired, and possibly what the impact is if the feature is _not_
implemented. "Because we need it" is not a sufficient reason!

## HOW

// if possible, outlines a solution proposal

## FURTHER NOTES

// anything else you want to outline
