    Checkstyle configuration that checks the Google coding conventions from Google Java Style
    that can be found at https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

    Checkstyle is very configurable. Be sure to read the documentation at
    http://checkstyle.org (or in your downloaded distribution).

    To completely disable a check, just comment it out or delete it from the file.
    To suppress certain violations please review suppression filters.
