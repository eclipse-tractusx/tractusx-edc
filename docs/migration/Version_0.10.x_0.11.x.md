## 1. DCP version 1.0
Tractus-X EDC now uses DCP 1.0 by defaultâ€”no switch is required. If DCP 0.8.1 was previously forced via `edc.dcp.v08.forced`, 
that setting should be removed; it is deprecated and no flag is provided for 1.0. As a DID (not a BPN) is now used as 
the primary identifier, the EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID must be updated to the corresponding DID. Also message fields like `participantId`, 
`assignee`, and `assigner` carry DID values instead of BPNs.
