## 1. Data Management API

It might be necessary to update applications and scripts that use the Data Management API. This section covers the most
important changes in endpoints and payloads.

### 1.1 Policy Payload

The id field of the PolicyDefinition was renamed from `uid` to `id`.

#### Old Call

```json
{
    "uid": "1",
    "policy": {
        "prohibitions": [],
        "obligations": [],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "edctype": "dataspaceconnector:permission",
                "action": {
                    "type": "USE"
                },
                "constraints": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### New call

```json
{
    "id": "1",
    "policy": {
        "prohibitions": [],
        "obligations": [],
        "permissions": [
            {
                "edctype": "dataspaceconnector:permission",
                "action": {
                    "type": "USE"
                },
                "constraints": []
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

## 2. Connector Configuration

### 2.1. CX OAuth Extension

All connectors are now shipped with a new OAuth extension. This extension has an additional mandatory setting called `edc.ids.endpoint.audience`, that must be set to the IDS path.

[Documentation](../../edc-extensions/cx-oauth2/README.md)

#### Example

```properties
edc.ids.endpoint.audience=http://plato-edc-controlplane:8282/api/v1/ids/data
```
