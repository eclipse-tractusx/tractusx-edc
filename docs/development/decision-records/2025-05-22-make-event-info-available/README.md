# Make event information available in basic logging & monitoring stack

## Decision

A small extension will be added to the Tractus-X connector which subscribes to all internal events 
and publishes the information directly to an OpenTelemetry collector instance via http.
The extension can be switched off/on via configuration. By default it is disabled.

## Rationale

The Tractus-X connector has an embedded event mechanism that informs potential listeners about specific incidents, 
like finalized contract negotiations or ongoing transfers. 
It should be possible to forward these events to a monitoring stack
to provide the information for further processing, e.g., for metric calculation or dashboards.
Using an OpenTelemetry collector instance is also agnostic to the concrete logging & monitoring stack used.

## Approach

1. Create a lightweight configurable extension which subscribes to all events.
2. By default, the events are published via http directly to the OpenTelemetry collector instance ( more info see here:
 https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/otlpreceiver/README.md ),
 which needs to be provided by the surrounding infrastructure.
3. The extension will be shipped with the existing Tractus-X connector distributions,
but will be disabled by default by means of connector configuration.
With this, potential problems regarding performance of the connector are not a concern,
only if the additional information is really needed.
