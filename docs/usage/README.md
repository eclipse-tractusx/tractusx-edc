# Domain Model

The Domain Model explains on a high level the concepts that the EDC introduces. As a lot of the terminology maps to
endpoints of the EDC Management API, it is preliminary for understanding the [Management API Walkthrough](management-api-walkthrough/README.md).

For a detailed explanation of EDC concepts, refer to the [upstream documentation](https://eclipse-edc.github.io/documentation/for-adopters/control-plane/).
